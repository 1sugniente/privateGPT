AutoCAD Raster Design 2019 has many features and benefits that can help you improve your raster to vector conversion workflow. Some of the features are:

- Raster Entity Manipulation (REM): This feature allows you to modify raster entities such as lines, arcs, circles, and text as if they were vector entities. You can move, rotate, scale, trim, extend, break, join, or erase raster entities with ease.
- Raster Underlay: This feature allows you to insert raster images as underlays in your vector drawings. You can adjust the brightness, contrast, fade, and transparency of the raster underlays. You can also snap to the raster underlay geometry or use it as a reference for tracing.
- Image Processing and Cleanup: This feature allows you to enhance the quality and appearance of your raster images. You can apply filters, adjust colors, remove noise, erase unwanted areas, crop, rotate, or resize your raster images.
- Vectorization Tools: This feature allows you to convert your raster images into vector drawings. You can use automatic or semi-automatic vectorization tools that detect and trace the edges, contours, or regions of your raster images. You can also use manual vectorization tools that let you draw lines, polylines, circles, or polygons over your raster images.

By using AutoCAD Raster Design 2019, you can save time and money by reusing your existing raster data and creating accurate and editable vector drawings. You can also integrate your raster and vector data in a single environment and share them with other AutoCAD users.
